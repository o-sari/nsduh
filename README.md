## Final Project Repository
Prediction of hard drug abuse probability based on non-sensitive factors.

Repository contains the report and workflow for conducted analysis.


### Workflow

Notebook 1: Construction of our observed quantity, the RFD-Score which aims to provide a measure for drug abuse probability.

Notebook 2: Pre-processing of data.

Notebook 3: Selection of relevant features and one-hot encoding of categorical features.

Notebook 4: Train & test of prediction models.
